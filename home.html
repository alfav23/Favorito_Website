        <h2>10.03 a little overwhelmed</h2>
        <hr>
          <p class="m-5">
            So far, the course work is exciting and fun, so I don’t think that it will feel like 
            a chore even as I continue through the semester. I am currently working on some models 
            for my group project in Maya, and I am learning some interesting techniques in Composite. 
            Previsualization is helping me re-center my goals and find out what I need to do to get 
            the most out of my time at Brookdale. I am a little overwhelmed, but ultimately, I am 
            excited to complete a fully rendered short movie. Everyone’s ideas are finally starting 
            to come together into a cohesive plan, despite several disagreements and (small) arguments. 
            This is my first time working as a team on a project like this. As someone who is shockingly 
            terrible at teamwork, it’s not comfortable, but it’s part of the job. I hope to continue 
            learning new skills and making connections with my peers.

        <h2>10.10 making a trombone </h2>
        <hr>
          <p class="m-5">I went in person to a class I normally attend online. It was a nice change of pace,
             and I got to see parts of the Brookdale campus that I have never seen before. 
             The class is Composite and is in the ATeC building. It is in the basement, so I was a 
             little bit creeped out at first, as I was supposed to be the only one in attendance in 
             person, however it was a nice room and there was a second person there besides me. I 
             had a lot of fun and felt more engaged rather than being at home where I tend to fall 
             asleep in my computer chair. It is a little bit too comfortable and has a lower back 
             massage pillow. We learned how to use sweep, loft, and spline tools in Cinema 4D. I had 
             to go in person because the disk on my computer at home is full. I bought an external 
             drive to add more storage and to open some space to run programs without them crashing 
             consistently because of scratch disk errors. I made a trombone in Cinema 4D for my 
             assignment making use of splines and the related tools. I play trombone and I own one, 
             so I used my own trombone as the model, and it made me very happy and reminded me why I 
             love what I study.

        <h2>10.17 Buffalo</h2>
        <hr>
          <p class="m-5">
            I went to Buffalo, NY to visit my friend who recently moved there with her husband and kids. 
            I used to tutor her kids in Spanish, and worked with her at a previous job, and I missed 
            seeing them. A couple of mutual friends and I visited and stayed near her apartment which 
            is about ten minutes from Niagra falls. We went to Niagra falls together and explored the 
            city, and barbequed and caught up, and then returned home Tuesday morning. I brought my 
            laptop and was able to code the basis of my website and join a zoom class, but I am trying 
            to cram my remaining larger assignments into the afternoons after work, which I’m just going 
            to pretend is possible (I work from 12:40 am-1:10pm for five days a week #consumerism #daddybezos). 
            I did this to myself; I accept my fate.

        <h2>10.24 progress </h2>
        <hr>
          <p class="m-5">
            We are making progress on our short movie in Maya. I completed the model for the second 
            creature that lives in the alien world that my group created. I’m hoping that by the end 
            of this week, we can be done with all of the models and start working more on the textures 
            and environment of our world. It looks like we are making good progress. I also have been 
            working on creating complex objects in Cinema 4D and edited my trombone into a video of a 
            music room using color correction and camera tracking among other After Effects tools. 
            After Effects 2025 was released a short while ago and it doesn’t seem much different so far. 
            I want to begin researching the best ways to make 3D environments for webtoons soon to start 
            creating objects and background to make the process easier for my webtoon. I haven’t had much 
            time to draw lately and am a bit sad about it, because I have one piece I stopped working on 
            halfway and want to get back to.
