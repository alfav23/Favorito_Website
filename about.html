          Alyssa Favorito is a New-Jersey-born 3D modeler, 
          artist, editor, front-end software developer, 
          and writer with experience in programs such as 
          Maya, Blender, After Effects, Cinema4D, Procreate,
          Photoshop, and Visual Studio Code. 
          Although initially an exclusively traditional artist,
          digital art began to pique her interest as she entered 
          her twenties. With its more forgiving nature, 
          she found herself experimenting with new techniques. 
          Naturally, this led her to begin her Associates at 
          Brookdale Community College in Digital and 3D Animation.
          She took a break to pursue front-end software development,
          which only deepened her love for technology and creation.
          With her extensive background in various trades such as
          carpentry, exterior detailing, and auto body work, 
          she possesses an astounding amount of attention to detail
          and form. Alyssa is trilingual. Possibly because of her 
          deep love of languages and all forms of communication, her
          artistic endeavors are an alternative to what otherwise 
          would be expressed inadequately with words.

        Mainly working in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python,
        Alyssa has experience with several coding languages 
        and tools. She has created websites that implement 3D
        and animated components using GSAP, React, Vite, and
        threeJS, among others. She also created a Pokémon-style
        RPG that runs entirely within a browser’s HTML canvas 
        element. Alyssa’s entire coding portfolio is on GitHub, 
        where you can fork and run all of her projects. 
        
        She has worked for the Veterans Association as an intern 
        creating graphics in honor of veterans as well leading 
        a team of graphic designers on other related projects.

            Using 3D modeling as a tool for referencing human
            anatomy and perspe ctive, as well as creating backgrounds 
            and props, Alyssa is creating a webcomic utilizing her
